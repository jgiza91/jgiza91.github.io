            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p> GIS 1<p>
			<p> GIS for natural systems management</p>
			<p> GIS 3<p>
            <p>Project 1</p>
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9lA7w2P.png">
			<p> This was a map I created as part of a final project in GIS 1. The overall purpose was to get a better understanding of the best neighborhoods to stay in within New York City based on a set of requirements and preferences.<p>
			<p> My requirements included low crime areas and access to public transportation.<p>
			<p> My preferences included neighborhoods with side walk cafes, access to water front parks, access to outdoor recreation, and being near Times Square. <p>
			<p> I concluded that Central Harlem is the best neighborhood to stay in while visiting New York City based on these requirements and preferences.<p>
			
            <p>Project 2</p>
			<p>Map 1
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/k4eGjFd.png">
			<p>Map 2
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RL4VijS.png">
			<p> These are two maps I created in GIS for natural systems management in which I compared suitable habitats for gray wolves under global warming conditions.<p>
			<p> I designed two different models which depicted current expected potential gray wolf habitats and potential future gray wolf habitats based on 2099 projections.<p> 
			<p> The models were generated on data sets consisting of temperature ranges, landcovers, rainfall patterns based on suitable habitats.<p>
			<p> Map 1 illustrates the range for current gray wolf habitats throughout the United States.<p>
			<P> Map 2 displays how the location of gray wolf habitats will change based on 2099 temperature, landcover, and rainfall projections.<p>
			<p> Future projections show how gray wolf habitats will decrease as the climate continues to warm. Their habitats are predicted to move to the Northwest region of the United States.<p>
			<p>Project 3</p>
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nTRik6G.png">
			<p> I created this map in GIS 1 with two other individuals in which we designed a project in order to help the Spring Valley Nature Center with creating a usable map that has a real world application for continuous use.<p>
			<p> We began with creating a orthogonal map image of the Center. Then used a base layer to map trees and benches.<p>
			<p> The conservation director asked us to map all of the memorial trees throughout the nature center which were all oaks. We used the Mapit app in order to obtain the coordinate points for our final map.<p>
			<p> We took the entire map, excel file, and overlay to create the .kml file which can be used to make any future changes.<p>
			<p>Project 4</p>
			<p> QGIS map<p>
			<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/U9D2bkd.jpg"
			
			<p> My QGIS map represents critical habitat ecoregions of the most endangered species in the United States. I used feature blending in this program to map the location of five critical endangered habitats which consisted of the long-eared bat, bighorn sheep, white river spinedace, Mississippi gopher frog, and the green sea turtle.<p>
